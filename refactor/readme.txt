So, I will just mention about the methods that I refactored. 

1) What makes it amazing code
what makes it amazing code is that the controller was using repository as class. which makes it easier to locate and modify queries when needed. This reduces code duplication and improves code maintainability.
 
2) Your thoughts about the code
The code didnt had anything complex. It was simple logics, though the dependency injection was a good thing.

3) what makes it terrible code
very basic code, as there was no error handling, validattions, response codes, variable naming.

4) Thoughts on formatting, structure
the phpdoc comments was good, plus I think there should be comments inside the methods too for the understanding to different developers that what the method really does.
Code consistency as code style for all methods are same, easy to read. 
About the structure I would say reposiitory was really good here. A good practice to managing dependencies.
